                        I am a student at Becker College currently working towards my BA in Interactive Media Design, Computer Game Design Concentration. I have loved playing video games my whole life and now I love designing and creating them. My favorite video game genre would have to be MMORPG.
                        I love the social aspect of the game and the massive sandbox world that you play in. I love creating colorful and fun levels and have been trying to perfect my craft everyday. The world is such an important thing in most video games and I want to be the one creating an awesome experience for people to enjoy.

In Edgelord, you play as a nameless character whose main goal is to find the portal within each level and escape.

                            Zoombies is a level based survival exercise game played in VR. This game was created in the Unity engine using the HTC Vive. I was an Assistant Design Lead for this project and was in charge of creating 3 of the 5 levels in the game. I worked in collaboration with 3 other designers. I created a forest, city, and graveyard level all in my vision. They all looked great and played smoothly. For this game we worked in collaboration with the company, Virzoom. We were able to make a game for them and they then are going to publish it.

                    During this time in one of my main classes, Game Studio, I held the position of Assistant Design Lead for VR Zoombies. This title meant that I was responsible for three other Designers in my class and was in charge of handing out weekly and monthly tasks for them. After every week I had to check their work
                    and give feedback on it. After each week I would get together with all of the other leads in the class and discuss progress.
